# FlaskWithFusionAuth

I was trying to use the sample from FusionAuth (https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-python-flask), but it didn't look like it was what I wanted. So, I decided to reimplement it differently and more serversided. Good luck using it, it's just authentication. If you've better ideas, please share :D
